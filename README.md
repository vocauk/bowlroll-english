Experimental user script and extension to translate BowlRoll into English

## About
Since BowlRoll has no English support and Google translating pages takes time + isn't very good, I decided to make this to instantly translate all of the user interface. The text is as accurate
as DeepL can get with some minor edits for things to make more sense, without changing the meaning.

## Download
User script is in the repository, I'll get this on extension stores etc when I can.

## What's not supported
* File index page sorting and buttons, this is a limitation with the script due to BowlRoll's file index using JavaScript to request content on the client side, however some of the page works fine
* File page passwords, tags and some buttons - same as above
* Privacy Policy and Terms of Use pages - this is more of a legal thing as I feel I cannot make an accurate translation
* Contact Us - BowlRoll support likely won't respond to responses not in Japanese, therefore there is no use translating this page. This and the other 2 pages all have "(Japanese only)" next to their links, 
similar to [niconico](https://nicovideo.jp/)'s English interface
* Report file page - same as above
* Probably file editing pages as I haven't uploaded any content myself, feel free to submit this
* R-18 pages - this is out of scope for the project as VOCA-UK has no use for it and I doubt it'd be allowed on extension stores

## License
This is more of a BowlRoll thing, as I'm unsure of the licensing regarding its text content. Most of the content uploaded seems to go by a license that follows the CC-BY-SA-NC, so I've set that for now.
